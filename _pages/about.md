I am graduate student at Graduate School of Engineering Biology in Korea Advanced Institute of Scicence and Technology (KAIST). I am interested in drug discovery since I want more people to live healthier. I am working on metabolic engineering for drug discovery using machine learning techniques. I am working on System Biology and Medical Lab (SBML) with advisor Hyun Uk Kim.

Skill

* Python: Can perform basic machine learning techniques(Numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow, statlearning)
* R: Can perform basic bioinformatics analysis
